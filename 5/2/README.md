This works, it is meant as a starter kit tho. Reply functions do not work yet because they can be implemented in several methods/looks. If you want to make an imageboard in rust, this gets you going fast! Just feed the code to ai and change one little thing at a time, and if ai gets the code wrong feed the error messages to ai or revert back to a working version.
