This is tinyib - i fixed the deprications so it runs on php 8.4.1 properly. I removed a lot of files and code to slim this down to sqlite3 version. So far its 21 files, most of which are slimmed down. This will take lots of work but the idea is to slim down all unnecesary code while still keeping functionality. When the code is slim enough to completely fit well into ai, it can be strictly converted from old code to php 8.4.1+ optimized code and given modern security. There is still lots to do on this, and the end version will be a radical change from the original version of tinyib. 

# version 000- 
did lots of slimming, now it all has to be tested well to make sure the slimming did not mess things up. So far it works well on php 8.4.1
